Somethings I've learned include: 
the print command (print("Hello World")),
input (input("What is the weather?"),
Commenting (put a # infront for code to not run),
Naming Conventions (start with a lowercase letter, capitalize the first letter of every word but the first, have it descriptive, etc.),
Type Casting,
Basic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
```
print("Hello World")
input("What is the weather?")
#Hello!
str(8) + "dollars"
if temperature >70:
  print("Wear a shirt and shorts")
