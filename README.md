# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

About Me: Hi, I'm Jura Klimanis and I'm a junior in high school. I want to go into data science which made me start learning python. This is my first computer language. I'm also taking a couple of other courses such as statistics and physics, and also have a part-time job at Kumon, a tutoring center. I really like flute and I've played it for around 6 years.
Goals for This Course: I want to be able to use python and be prepared for an advanced python course and an introduction to data science course. I mostly just want to get used to coding.
My First Python Program: print("Hello, World!")
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
